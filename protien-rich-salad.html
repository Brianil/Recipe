    <figcaption>This is just a figure of speech, the actual salad won't look like that.</figcaption>
    <p>I have turned vegeterian who eats egg a month ago. It might be possible that i will turn into a plant based only in future but thats only for fun. I am good with any food and it's my choice to opt for some vegeterian food for now.</p>
    <p>This recipe will contain only vegetables which are available in nearby market in India or north india to be specific.</p>
